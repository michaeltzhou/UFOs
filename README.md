# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to take a webpage and dynamic table and update it using JavaScript to allow users to filter sightings with additional criteria at the same time.
## Results
With the new code, users now have additional criteria that can be used to filter the UFO dataset, including City, State, Country, and Shape. In the image below, the dataset was set to be filter results that were in the state of Kansas:

This resulted in two sightings.

## Summary
* One drawback of this page is that the filter is extremely case-sensitive. For example, under the 'State' filter, 'Ks' would not work if typed in, only 'ks'
* One improvement to the page would be making the filters less case-sentitive, thus making it more user-friendly
* Another improvement to the page would be additional filter options
